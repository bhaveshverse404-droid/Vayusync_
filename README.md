- **VAYUSYNC Answers:** *"What does this weather mean for THIS USER?"* & *"What should THIS USER do about it?"*

### Two-Layer User Experience

1. **State 1: Standard Mausam (Default Platform)**
   - Authentic, complete national meteorological portal.
   - City search & GPS geolocation.
   - Comprehensive current conditions (Temp, Feels Like, High/Low, Humidity, Wind, Pressure, Visibility, UV, Sunrise/Sunset).
   - 24-Hour Hourly Forecast rail & 7-Day Outlook table.
   - Official IMD Weather Warning Bulletin (Green = No Warning, Yellow = Watch, Orange = Alert, Red = Warning).

2. **State 2: VayuSync Personalized Mausam (Intelligence Layer)**
   - Activated seamlessly via the *"✨ Personalize Mausam"* onboarding modal.
   - User defines **Interests** (Multi-select: *Commute, Running, Travel, Events, Gardening, Beach, Health, Cycling*) and **Weather Priorities** (*Rain, Heat, AQI, UV, Wind*).
   - **Personalized Mausam Suitability Score (0–100)**: Dynamically calculated day score reflecting friction across the user's specific activities.
   - **Calendar & Schedule Conflict Detector**: Scans upcoming outdoor events (e.g. *"Outdoor Cricket at 5:00 PM: 70% Rain Alert"*) and recommends optimal alternate windows (e.g. *"Shift to 7:00 PM when rain probability drops to 20%"*).
   - **The "Should-I?" Decision Engine**: Evaluates questions like *"Should I carry an umbrella?"*, *"Can I wash my car?"*, *"Is it safe to ride my bike?"*.
   - **24-Hour Routine Synchronization**: Aligns the user's personal daily schedule with hourly weather shifts.

## 2. Quick Start (One-Click Launch)

### Option A: Windows One-Click Launcher (`start.bat`)
Double-click `start.bat` in File Explorer, or run from command prompt:
```bat
start.bat
```
This automatically boots the FastAPI backend, launches the Next.js web application, and opens your default browser at **http://localhost:3000**.

### Option B: Cross-Platform Python Launcher (`start.py`)
Run from terminal:
```bash
python start.py
```
This runs both servers concurrently, monitors health, opens the browser, and cleanly terminates both processes upon `Ctrl+C`.
